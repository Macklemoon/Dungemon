Note I
	Use WASD to move the character; ConsoleProgram is used in the battles.
	
Note II
	The canvas sometimes doesn't work. No real reason why, but the only way 
	is to close the window, and run the program again.

Note III
	The default Pokemon starter given is Charmander. If you wish to change it to Squirtle or Bulbasaur, manipulate line "194" in the "Main" 
	class to their respective names.
	
Note IV
	Do note that sometimes the code decides to go off the fritz and disengages the movement lock placed on the player's sprite on the HUBWorld. 
	Do not be alarmed, just continue trucking on.
		
Note V	
	Raise volume for the best experience.
	
Note VI
	Have fun!!!
